# Double Seals
A Balatro mod that introduces new seal variants that double the effects of the underlying seal.

### Supported Seals:
  - The base 4 seals: effects doubled.
  - New Orange Seal: randomly enhances 1 or 2 random cards from your hand when discarded.
  - New Silver Seal: creates 1 or 2 Spectral cards when held in hand at end of round

This mod also includes the necessary custom API file for this mod to work. This may change as balamod receives updates.
Feel free to use this for your own seal mods!

Requires [Balamod](https://github.com/UwUDev/balamod/)
